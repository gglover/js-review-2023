## A survey of modern web technologies as of early 2023
This is an ecommerce site with API endpoints provided by https://fakestoreapi.com/. The goal is to hone in on
more informed opinions about modern JS project structuring and to try out some recent tools that I haven't had
a chance to play with. Most of what's used here will be overkill for the scope of the project but the idea is to 
land on a format with the potential to scale.

### Tech to learn
- React Query
- React Transition Group
- Vite
- Tighter Typescript configuration
- CSS modules
- Better CSS variable usage
